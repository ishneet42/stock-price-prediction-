# Stock Price Prediction Using News Sentiment and S&P 500 Data ðŸ“ˆ

**Stock Price Prediction Using News Sentiment and S&P 500 Data**: Leveraging real-time news sentiment and historical S&P 500 data with LSTM and RNN models for dynamic stock price forecasting.

## Overview
This ongoing project aims to predict stock prices by analyzing **news sentiment** and historical **S&P 500 data**. The model combines real-time news data, gathered through the **NewsAPI**, with financial indicators from the **S&P 500** dataset to forecast stock movements. By leveraging machine learning, specifically **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** and **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**, the goal is to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating both market trends and public sentiment.

## Features
- **News Sentiment Analysis**: Collects real-time news data related to specific stocks using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and evaluates sentiment using natural language processing (NLP).
- **S&P 500 Historical Data**: Fetches and processes historical data of S&P 500 companies to build robust stock price prediction models.
- **LSTM and RNN Models**: Uses deep learning techniques like LSTM and RNN for time series forecasting.
- **Real-time Stock Prediction**: Incorporates real-time news sentiment with historical data for dynamic prediction.

## Data Sources
- **NewsAPI**: For gathering real-time news articles and sentiment analysis.
- **S&P 500 Dataset**: Historical data sourced from Yahoo Finance, which includes open, close, high, low, and volume prices of stocks.

## Ongoing Development
This project is a work in progress, with future plans to:
- Improve sentiment analysis by adding custom-trained NLP models.
- Incorporate additional financial indicators (moving averages, RSI, etc.) to enhance prediction performance.
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning, adding more complex deep learning architectures.
- Build a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing real-time stock predictions.
